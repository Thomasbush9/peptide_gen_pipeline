Pipeline for pepdtide generation for the Kempner Institute


Review: 

- Boltz-gen: installed, scripts made + ready to run on multi gpus
- Bindcraft: isntalled, runs on a single gpu -> find way to make it run on multiple 

- Boltz-2: running + optimized for multipredictions 
- AF3: to do 

Overview of the Pipeline: gen pepdtide (bg, bc)-> validate on AF3 and B2
new thing to consider is to add profiler to boltz two and gen and see whether we have to compile the models
